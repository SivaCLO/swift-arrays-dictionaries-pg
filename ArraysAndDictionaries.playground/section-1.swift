/* #Arrays

Arrays store ordered lists of multiple values of the same type. Swiftâ€™s use of explicitly typed collections ensures that code is always clear about the types of values it can work with. They differ from  Objective-C's NSArray and NSMutableArray classes, which can store any kind of object and do not provide any information about the nature of the objects they return.
